 To debug an autogenerated kernel:

    - Copy an autogenerated .cu file to debug.cu (overwriting)
    - Edit debug.cu to rename __globals__ (to avoid name collisions) and specify k.debug=true
    - This allows the debug.cu kernels to take precedence over the autogenerated kernels.
    - The Makefile will automatically compile debug.cu.
    - Note also that debug.cu is not deleted by 'make clean'.
    - Just delete debug.cu when done debugging.
