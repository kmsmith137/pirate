### Building

- Most important Makefile targets: `make clean`, `make -j 32 [all]`, `make src_lib/FILE.o`, and `make src_pybind11/FILE.o`.
- Files in `src_lib/autogenerated_kernels/` are autogenerated -- do not edit.
- CRITICAL: Always build multiple targets with 32 threads: `make -j 32`.

### More info

- If a prompt mentions the Makefile or autogenerated kernels, read `notes/build.md` into context.
- If a prompt mentions python bindings or pybind11, then please read `notes/pybind11.md` into context.
- If a prompt mentions the "thread-backed class" pattern, then please read `notes/thread_backed_class.md` into context.
- If you need more information on `ksgpu::Array`, see `include/ksgpu/Array.hpp`.

### Style/coding Guidelines

- Prefer private (or static) functions over anonymous scopes `{ ... }`.
- Use `//` comments, not `/* */`
- Use `long` for sizes and indices, not `int` or `size_t`
- Use spaces, not tabs.
- Functions which take an `ostream &` argument should not modify stream state in the caller.
- All functions should error-check function arguments thoroughly and throw an exception if anything is wrong, unless the function is in a "hot loop". 
- In contexts where it's not important to customize exception text, use the exception-throwing macros `xassert()`, `xassert_eq()`, `xassert_le()`, `xassert_divisible()` from `include/ksgpu/xassert.hpp`.
- Please write comments to explain big-picture functionality or non-obvious issues, but avoid superficial comments. 
- Please ask me questions in the chat if my instructions are incomplete or unclear.
